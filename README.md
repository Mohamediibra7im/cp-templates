A new and growing collection of my personal C++ templates for competitive programming. This repository is currently under construction, and I will be adding and organizing templates over time.

## About This Repository

This project will house a curated set of C++ templates that I use for contests on platforms like Codeforces, LeetCode, and AtCoder. The goal is to build a reliable and optimized toolkit for common competitive programming problems.

## Future Structure

The plan is to organize all templates into folders based on their category (e.g., `Data Structures`, `Graph Algorithms`, `Math`, etc.). Please check back later to see the progress!

## How to Use

For now, you can browse the files in the repository to find what you need.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mohamediibra7im/cp-templates.git
    ```
2.  **Find and copy the code** from the relevant file into your solution.

## Contributing

While this is a personal collection, suggestions are always welcome. Feel free to open an issue if you have an idea!
